# Codex Babil

"Complete" library of all* scriptures with all** possible writing systems. And a (admittedly terrible) text-to-speech to read the script aloud.

*Up to a certain length.
**...that use distinct symbols (or 'letters', 'glymps') for language representation.

## How is this different from a regular Library of Babel?

Alphabets are random. Writing directions are random. Pronounciations are random, but one-to-one matching with the symbols. (more like, say, Turkish or Hungarian or Japanese rather than English or French).
